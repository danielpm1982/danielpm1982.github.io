front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.[11] It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru.[12] Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.[13] Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages[14], with Nuxt.js as one of the most popular solutions[citation needed] Vue.js lets you extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives.[15] The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives. Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process: "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight."[16] The first source code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014. Vue components extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. At a high level, components are custom elements to which the Vue’s compiler attaches behavior. In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue instance with pre-defined options.[33] ue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows binding the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instance\'s data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM render functions. A virtual Document Object Model (or “DOM”) allows Vue to render components in its memory before updating the browser. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue is able to calculate the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes. Vue users can use template syntax or choose to directly write render functions using JSX.[34] Render functions allow application to be built from software components.[35] Vue features a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimized re-rendering. Each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies during its render, so the system knows precisely when to re-render, and which components to re-render.[36] Vue provides a variety of ways to apply transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. A traditional disadvantage of single-page applications (SPAs) is the inability to share links to the exact "sub" page within a specific web page. Because SPAs serve their users only one URL-based response from the server (it typically serves index.html or index.vue), bookmarking certain screens or sharing links to specific sections is normally difficult if not impossible. To solve this problem, many client-side routers delimit their dynamic URLs with a "hashbang" (#!), e.g. page.com/#!/. However, with HTML5 most modern browsers support routing without hashbangs. Vue provides an interface to change what is displayed on the page based on the current URL path -- regardless of how it was changed (whether by emailed link, refresh, or in-page links). Additionally, using a front-end router allows for the intentional transition of the browser path when certain browser events (i.e. clicks) occur on buttons or links. Vue itself doesn’t come with front-end hashed routing. But the open source "vue-router" package provides an API to update the application\'s URL, supports the back button (navigating history), and email password resets or email verification links with authentication URL parameters. It supports mapping nested routes to nested components and offers fine-grained transition control. With Vue, developers are already composing applications with small building blocks building larger components. With vue-router added to the mix, components must merely be mapped to the routes they belong to, and parent/root routes must indicate where children should render.[39] '),n("br"),n("br"),e._v(" Source:"),n("br"),e._v(" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js ")])])}],Q=(n("86c8"),{}),Z=Object(d["a"])(Q,Y,K,!1,null,"23c0abe1",null),ee=Z.exports,te=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement;e._self._c;return e._m(0)},ne=[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("div",{staticClass:"centralTextVuejs"},[n("div",{staticClass:"justifyAlign"},[e._v(" Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts. Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name \"Node.js\" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[7] The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9] Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[10] Groupon,[11] IBM,[12] LinkedIn,[13][14] Microsoft,[15][16] Netflix,[17] PayPal,[18][19] Rakuten, SAP,[20] Voxer,[21] Walmart,[22] and Yahoo!.[23] Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009,[24] about thirteen years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.[25] The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.[26] Dahl criticized the limited possibilities of the most popular web server in 2009, Apache HTTP Server, to handle a lot of concurrent connections (up to 10,000 and more) and the most common way of creating code (sequential programming), when code either blocked the entire process or implied multiple execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections.[27] Dahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on 8 November 2009.[28][29][30] Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.[31] In January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called npm.[32] The package manager makes it easier for programmers to publish and share source code of Node.js packages and is designed to simplify installation, updating, and uninstallation of packages.[31] In June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js.[33] The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011. In January 2012, Dahl stepped aside, promoting coworker and npm creator Isaac Schlueter to manage the project.[34] In January 2014, Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.[35] In December 2014, Fedor Indutny started io.js, a fork of Node.js. Due to the internal conflict over Joyent's governance, io.js was created as an open governance alternative with a separate technical committee.[36][37] Unlike Node.js,[38] the authors planned to keep io.js up-to-date with the latest releases of the Google V8 JavaScript engine.[39] In February 2015, the intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was announced. By June 2015, the Node.js and io.js communities voted to work together under the Node.js Foundation.[40] In September 2015, Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 were merged back together into Node v4.0.[41] This merge brought V8 ES6 features into Node.js and a long-term support release cycle.[42] As of 2016, the io.js website recommends that developers switch back to Node.js and that no further releases of io.js are planned due to the merge.[43] In 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation. Node.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of \"modules\" that handle various core functionalities.[28][31][44][45][46] Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL, or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams, and other core functions.[31][45][47] Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.[31][45] JavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available.[48] As a result, Node.js applications can be written in CoffeeScript,[49] Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others. Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as Web servers.[44] The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands only execute after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently or even in parallel,[50][51] and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).[44] Node.js is officially supported on Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later),[3] with tier 2 support for SmartOS and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions available for IBM i (AS/400).[52] The provided source code may also be built on similar operating systems to those officially supported or be modified by third parties to support others such as NonStop OS[53] and Unix servers. Node.js brings event-driven programming to web servers, enabling development of fast web servers in JavaScript.[31] Developers can create scalable servers without using threading, by using a simplified model of event-driven programming that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task.[31] Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.[31] Node.js was built on top of the Google V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced under the BSD license. It is proficient with internet fundamentals such as HTTP, DNS, TCP.[28] JavaScript was also a well-known language, making Node.js accessible to the web development community.[28] There are thousands of open-source libraries for Node.js, most of them hosted on the npm website. The Node.js developer community has two main mailing lists and the IRC channel #node.js on freenode. There are multiple developer conferences and events that support the Node.js community, including NodeConf, Node Interactive, and Node Summit as well as a number of regional events. The open-source community has developed web frameworks to accelerate the development of applications. Such frameworks include Connect, Express.js, Socket.IO, Feathers.js, Koa.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js, Meteor, Derby, and many others.[31][54] Various packages have also been created for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments such as Microsoft .NET.[55] Modern desktop IDEs provide editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such IDEs include Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm,[56][57] Microsoft Visual Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio,[58] or TypeScript with Node definitions,[59][60][61][62]) NetBeans,[63] Nodeclipse Enide Studio[64] (Eclipse-based), and Visual Studio Code.[65][66] Certain online web-based IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Codenvy, Cloud9 IDE, Koding, and the visual flow editor in Node-RED. Node.js is supported across a number of cloud hosting platforms like Jelastic, Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Joyent and others. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that processes incoming requests in a loop, called the event loop. Node.js uses libuv underhood to handle asynchronous events. Libuv is an abstraction layer for network and file system functionality on both Windows and POSIX-based systems such as Linux, macOS, OSS on NonStop, and Unix. Node.js operates on a single-thread event loop, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections without incurring the cost of thread context switching.[69] The design of sharing a single thread among all the requests that use the observer pattern is intended for building highly concurrent applications, where any function performing I/O must use a callback. To accommodate the single-threaded event loop, Node.js uses the libuv library—which, in turn, uses a fixed-sized thread pool that handles some of the non-blocking asynchronous I/O operations.[7] A thread pool handles the execution of parallel tasks in Node.js. The main thread function call posts tasks to the shared task queue, which threads in the thread pool pull and execute. Inherently non-blocking system functions such as networking translate to kernel-side non-blocking sockets, while inherently blocking system functions such as file I/O run in a blocking way on their own threads. When a thread in the thread pool completes a task, it informs the main thread of this, which in turn, wakes up and executes the registered callback. A downside of this single-threaded approach is that Node.js doesn't allow vertical scaling by increasing the number of CPU cores of the machine it is running on without using an additional module, such as cluster,[50] StrongLoop Process Manager,[70] or pm2.[71] However, developers can increase the default number of threads in the libuv thread pool. The server operating system (OS) is likely to distribute these threads across multiple cores.[72] Another problem is that long-lasting computations and other CPU-bound tasks freeze the entire event-loop until completion.[citation needed] V8 is the JavaScript execution engine which was initially built for Google Chrome. It was then open-sourced by Google in 2008. Written in C++, V8 compiles JavaScript source code to native machine code at runtime. [7] As of 2016, it also includes Ignition, a bytecode interpreter. npm is the pre-installed package manager for the Node.js server platform. It installs Node.js programs from the npm registry, organizing the installation and management of third-party Node.js programs. Packages in the npm registry can range from simple helper libraries such as Lodash to task runners such as Grunt. Node.js can be combined with a browser, a database that supports JSON data (such as Postgres,[73] MongoDB, or CouchDB) and JSON for a unified JavaScript development stack. With the adaptation of what were essentially server-side development patterns such as MVC, MVP, MVVM, etc., Node.js allows the reuse of the same model and service interface between client side and server side. Node.js registers with the operating system so the OS notifies it of connections and issues a callback. Within the Node.js runtime, each connection is a small heap allocation. Traditionally, relatively heavyweight OS processes or threads handled each connection. Node.js uses an event loop for scalability, instead of processes or threads.[74] In contrast to other event-driven servers, Node.js's event loop does not need to be called explicitly. Instead, callbacks are defined, and the server automatically enters the event loop at the end of the callback definition. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no further callbacks to be performed. Node.js supports WebAssembly and as of Node 14 has an experimental support of WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface. NodeJS provides a way to make \"addons\" via a C-based API called N-API which can be used to produce loadable .node modules from source code written in C/C++.[75] The modules can be directly loaded into memory and executed from within JS environment. The implementation of the N-API relies on internal C/C++ NodeJS and V8 objects requiring users to import (#include) NodeJS specific headers.[75] As NodeJS platform constantly evolves the API compatibility may get broken sometimes by a new version so third parties have introduced open-sourced С/С++ wrappers on top of the API that partially alleviate the problem. They simplify interfaces but as side effect they also introduce undue complexity which developers have to deal with. Even though the core functionality of Node.js resides in a JavaScript library, modules written in C++ can be used to enhance capabilities of applications or to improve performance.

There is the "main" process and several "renderer" processes. The main process runs the application logic, and can then launch multiple renderer processes, rendering the windows that appear on a user\'s screen rendering HTML and CSS. Both the main and renderer processes can run with Node.js integration if enabled. Most of Electron\'s APIs are written in C++ or Objective-C and then exposed directly to the application code through JavaScript bindings.[12] Because Electron applications are web applications running in the Chromium engine, they may be vulnerable to web-related attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks, through the same attack vectors as a browser (e.g. Chromium) or other internal components (Node.js) if using certain versions of Electron.[13] Examples of such vulnerabilities have been fixed in the 1.7.13, 1.8.4, and 2.0.0-beta.5 Electron releases.[14] Electron applications have been criticized for containing very significant overhead due to their Chromium dependency, especially when their performance is compared to that of similar native applications.[15][16] '),n("br"),n("br"),e._v(" Source:"),n("br"),e._v(" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework) ")])])}],ce=(n("4af3"),{}),le=Object(d["a"])(ce,re,se,!1,null,"38c4022a",null),de=le.exports,pe=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement;e._self._c;return e._m(0)},ue=[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("div",{staticClass:"centralTextVuejs"},[n("div",{staticClass:"justifyAlign"},[e._v(" TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[4] As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,[5] or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript. TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.[6] The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, beside C# and other Microsoft languages.[7] An official extension allows Visual Studio 2012 to support TypeScript as well.[8] Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.[9][10][11][12] TypeScript was first made public in October 2012 (at version 0.8), after two years of internal development at Microsoft.[13][14] Soon after the announcement, Miguel de Icaza praised the language itself, but criticized the lack of mature IDE support apart from Microsoft Visual Studio, which was not available on Linux and OS X at that time.[15][16] Today there is support in other IDEs, particularly in Eclipse, via a plug-in contributed by Palantir Technologies.[17][18] Various text editors, including Emacs, Vim, Webstorm, Atom[19] and Microsoft's own Visual Studio Code also support TypeScript.[20] TypeScript 0.9, released in 2013, added support for generics.[21] TypeScript 1.0 was released at Microsoft's Build developer conference in 2014.[22] Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provides built-in support for TypeScript.[23] In July 2014, the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler, claiming 5× performance gains. Simultaneously, the source code, which was initially hosted on CodePlex, was moved to GitHub.[24] On 22 September 2016, TypeScript 2.0 was released; it introduced several features, including the ability for programmers to optionally prevent variables from being assigned null values,[25] sometimes referred to as the billion-dollar mistake. TypeScript 3.0 was released on 30 July 2018,[26] bringing many language additions like tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions, rest parameters with tuple types, generic rest parameters and so on.[27] TypeScript originated from the shortcomings of JavaScript for the development of large-scale applications both at Microsoft and among their external customers.[28] Challenges with dealing with complex JavaScript code led to demand for custom tooling to ease developing of components in the language.[29] TypeScript developers sought a solution that would not break compatibility with the standard and its cross-platform support. Knowing that the current ECMAScript standard proposal promised future support for class-based programming, TypeScript was based on that proposal. That led to a JavaScript compiler with a set of syntactical language extensions, a superset based on the proposal, that transforms the extensions into regular JavaScript. In this sense TypeScript was a preview of what to expect of ECMAScript 2015. A unique aspect not in the proposal, but added to TypeScript, is optional static typing[30] that enables static language analysis, which facilitates tooling and IDE support. TypeScript adds support for features such as classes, modules, and an arrow function syntax as defined in the ECMAScript 2015 standard. TypeScript is a language extension that adds features to ECMAScript 6. Additional features include: Type annotations and compile-time type checking Type inference Type erasure Interfaces Enumerated types Generics Namespaces Tuples Async/await The following features are backported from ECMAScript 2015: Classes Modules[31] Abbreviated \"arrow\" syntax for anonymous functions Optional parameters and default parameters Syntactically, TypeScript is very similar to JScript .NET, another Microsoft implementation of the ECMA-262 language standard that added support for static typing and classical object-oriented language features such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and namespaces. TypeScript is a strict superset of ECMAScript 2015, which is itself a superset of ECMAScript 5, commonly referred to as JavaScript.[32] As such, a JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program, and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript. By default the compiler targets ECMAScript 5, the current prevailing standard, but is also able to generate constructs used in ECMAScript 3 or 2015. With TypeScript, it is possible to use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript-generated code from other JavaScript.[33] Type declarations for these libraries are provided with the source code. TypeScript provides static typing through type annotations to enable type checking at compile time. This is optional and can be ignored to use the regular dynamic typing of JavaScript. The annotations for the primitive types are number, boolean and string. Weakly- or dynamically-typed structures are of type any. Type annotations can be exported to a separate declarations file to make type information available for TypeScript scripts using types already compiled into JavaScript. Annotations can be declared for an existing JavaScript library, as has been done for Node.js and jQuery. The TypeScript compiler makes use of type inference to infer types when types are not given. For example, the add method in the code above would be inferred as returning a number even if no return type annotation had been provided. This is based on the static types of left and right being numbers, and the compiler's knowledge that the result of adding two numbers is always a number. However, explicitly declaring the return type allows the compiler to verify correctness. If no type can be inferred because of lack of declarations, then it defaults to the dynamic any type. A value of the any type supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript and minimal static type checking is performed for operations on any values.[34] When a TypeScript script gets compiled there is an option to generate a declaration file (with the extension .d.ts) that functions as an interface to the components in the compiled JavaScript. In the process the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the exported virtual TypeScript types of a JavaScript library or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript. TypeScript supports ECMAScript 2015 classes that integrate the optional type annotations support. TypeScript supports generic programming.[35] The following is an example of the identity function.[36] TypeScript distinguishes between modules and namespaces. Both features in TypeScript support encapsulation of classes, interfaces, functions and variables into containers. Namespaces (formerly internal modules) utilize immediately-invoked function expression of JavaScript to encapsulate code, whereas modules (formerly external modules) leverage JavaScript library patterns to do so (AMD or CommonJS).[37] The TypeScript compiler, named tsc, is written in TypeScript. As a result, it can be compiled into regular JavaScript and can then be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser). The compiler package comes bundled with a script host that can execute the compiler. It is also available as a Node.js package that uses Node.js as a host. There is also an alpha version of a client-side compiler in JavaScript, which executes TypeScript code on the fly, upon page load.[38] The current version of the compiler supports ECMAScript 5 by default. An option is allowed to target ECMAScript 2015 to make use of language features exclusive to that version (e.g. generators). Classes, despite being part of the ECMAScript 2015 standard, are available in both modes.
